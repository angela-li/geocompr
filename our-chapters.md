- Part I: Foundations

1. spatial-data - rl

1. spatial - jn
1. transform - jn
1. read-write - rl

- Part II: Applications

1. transport rl
1. location-analysis - jm
1. land-use analysis - jn (optional)

- Part III: Methods for geocomputation

1. advanced-visualization - jn
    - **Making maps with R** will demonstrate a range of map-making packages for static, interactive and animates maps.
1. raster-vector - jn
    - This chapter will go beyond the content in chapter 5 by demonstrating methods for converting between raster and vector representations of the world. It will involve creating continuous surfaces from point data via voronoi polygons and spatial interpolation (including kriging)
    
1. spatial-crossvalidation - jm
    - This chapter will cover spatial cross-validation, i.e., it shows how to account for spatial autocorrelation when using statistical learning techniques for spatial predictions.
1. advanced-visualization - jn
1. algorithms-functions - rl
    - This chapter will demonstrate how algorithms work as a sequential list of operations to be performed many times. The ability to create new algorithms and place them in R functions will be demonstrated using examples, such as the creation of shapes representing probability of being between two points (using the concept of brownian bridges), automatic scenarios of infrastructure change (bulding on the Bristol example) and remote sensing algorithms to predict land use.
1. gis-bridges - jm
    - This chapter will demonstrate how R can be used as an interface to established desktop GIS programs
1. big-geodata - ? (optional)
    - This is a chapter we are considering, that would provide pointers on how to handle large geographic datasets with R.

- Part IV: Geocomputation in action
    
- ecological - jm
- renewable energy (?)
- sea level rise (?)

- synthesis (?)
